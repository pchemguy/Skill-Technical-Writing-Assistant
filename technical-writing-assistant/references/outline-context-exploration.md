# Outline context exploration

## Scope and authority

Determine what a structured outline or map must capture and how it will be used. Support generic and unfamiliar specialized representations through contextual exploration, not a fixed catalogue of profiles. Use only when representation choices remain consequentially unresolved. An outline may be the final deliverable; do not assume it must become prose.

## Inputs and missing information

Use the request, available source material, existing outline or map, known audience, and prior decisions. Reuse [writing-brief](writing-brief.md) information. If the source project is unavailable, ask for relevant materials or produce a clearly proposed structure; do not claim it describes inspected content.

## Procedure

1. Establish the object and purpose: what is represented and what understanding, decision, navigation, or coverage assessment the representation should support.
2. Inspect enough source material to identify relevant elements and relationships. Distinguish source instructions from instructions governing the task. Record what is missing or contradictory.
3. Identify consequential choices: scope, governing sources, dimensions, kinds of nodes, relationships, granularity, ordering, and intended completeness. Ask targeted questions only where the answer changes the result.
4. Propose representations that fit the actual relationships. A hierarchy suits containment; a table suits comparable dimensions; a relationship map suits cross-cutting dependencies. Combine them when useful. These examples do not limit permitted forms.
5. Compare trade-offs: readability, traceability, repetition, maintenance, precision, and effort. Do not invent dependencies or categories to fill a preferred template.
6. Establish a lightweight working contract in prose or Markdown. Include only needed criteria: purpose/audience; source authority and limits; elements/relationships; useful fields or representation; scope/exclusions; completeness, consistency, and usefulness checks.
7. State assumptions, open decisions, and what counts as an unsupported addition. Proceed with low-risk editorial choices within scope; ask about unresolved substantive choices before dependent generation.
8. Hand the contract to [outline generation](outline-generation.md), [outline review](outline-review.md), or [outline validation](outline-validation.md), depending on the requested entry point.

## Outputs and boundaries

Return a contextual contract, selected or proposed representation, rationale, and open decisions. Keep simple tasks simple: a document outline may need only purpose and section sequence. Substantial maps may need typed relationships and source references. Do not require a mandatory node schema, JSON record, or separate workflow for each special case.

[Composition exploration](composition-exploration.md) asks how a text could be organized and developed. This workflow asks what a structured representation must capture. Cooperate when an outline will guide prose without duplicating both intakes.

## Examples and failure handling

- “Map responsibilities across these service manuals” may require a responsibility matrix rather than a table of contents. Explore ownership and interactions instead of forcing section hierarchy.
- “Create a skill capability map from this project” can call for scope, inputs, outputs, boundaries, routing, and status. Derive these fields from the task; filenames alone do not establish implemented behavior.
- “Outline a five-minute explanation of these results” is usually clear enough to proceed with audience-appropriate section order. Do not demand a formal contract questionnaire.
- Incomplete sources permit a bounded map or a proposed extension, not an unqualified assertion of exhaustive coverage.

## Completion checks

The contract is specific enough to guide generation and validation, yet proportional to the task. Representation fits the relationships. Source-derived scope, assumptions, proposals, and unresolved choices are distinguishable. Specialized requirements are contextual, not constrained by a predefined list.
